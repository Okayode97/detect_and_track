    "- `fbgem` backend, is `optimized for x86 platforms such as intels CPU`. It uses efficient algorithms and instructions specific to x86 hardware to maximize performance. It's optimized for x86 server CPU and is widely used in data center environment where intel or AMD x86 processors are predominant.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `qnnpack` is optimized for mobile devices such as ARM CPUs and is designed to offer efficient performance on smartphones and tablets, making it suitable for mobile applications. qnnpack supports 8-bit integer quantization and provides optimizations for mobile inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `onednn` is an `intel-developed library that provides optimization for both CPU and GPU`. It's used for server-side applications where intel hardware is predominant. It can be useful for both quantized and floating point compuations. Also worth noting that `onednn` is `focused on x86 intel platforms`, the key difference between it and `fbgem` is that it's `more versatile in that it provides optimization for both CPU and GPU`\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that i've switched from running the model locally on the raspberry pi to hosting it on a fastapi server on an old linux server, i can't use qnnpack backend so that leaves `x86`, `onednn`, `fbgem`, also looking at the benchmarking results with the model quantized with qnnpack, had the longest inference time. With fbgem and x86 giving the *best reduction in inference time* \n",
